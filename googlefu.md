###GOOGLE FU

So you've hit thing that you don't know or one thats confusing. Welcome to the wonderful world of computers! I'm guessing as 
the tech savvy person that you are you've probably hit a snag 
on something in your life and went and google it and just kinda 
figured it out from there, right?

And you're probably thinking oh, but **REAL** programmers don't 
do that they understand or must have some other place that they
go. Well... not really lol.

There's some great streams that programmers do of their work 
flow and honestly 40 - 60% is just Googling. Like, for the same
thing just different combinations of words trying to find the
other person who dealt with the same problem (because **true 
fact:** *that person exists and someone answered his/her
 question*).

 It basically just comes down to tricks I mainly added this in 
 here to share some of the most effective tricks I've found

 1. Stack Overflow
  *if one of your google results is this check it out it's like
  tech support where programmers answer one anothers questions*

  *a lot of times the answer to a smaller question will be
   buried in the answers/comments of a larger question

 2. "Whatever your searching" cheatsheet

 3. "something you understand" vs "something you don't understand"
  *this one works reaaaally well for database relationships*

 4. "The top line of the error message just straight-up copy pasted"
 *optionally: with the language name afterwards lol*

 There are others that are more language dependent but play
around with it and let me know if you find any helpful ones
I didn't include.
